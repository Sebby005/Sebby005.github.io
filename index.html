    <h1>Te extrano Yarexzy.</h1>


<p>I can understand why you don't want to hear from me. I do.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It was my decision to do what I did and mine only. I made a mistake. I'm not perfect.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It hurts to think that you're moving on. You make it look so easy.</p>
    <br>
    I tried so hard to make things right for us. I believed that we were meant to be, and I left my pride behind to go look for you.<br>
    <p>You weren't there. All I wanted was to convince you to come back to my arms. I know it sounds selfish, but I knew what my intentions were.</p>
