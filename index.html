    <h1>Te extrano Yarexzy.</h1>


<p>I can understand why you don't want to hear from me. I do.</p><br><p>It was my decision to do what I did. I made a mistake. I'm not perfect.</p><br><p>It hurts to think that you're moving on. You make it look so easy.</p><br>I tried so hard to make things right for us. I believed that we were meant to be, and I left my pride behind to go look for you.<br><p>You weren't there. I wanted to convince you to come back to my arms. I know it sounds selfish, but I knew what my intentions were. I knew I would make it up to you, and I would love you how I always have. Unconditionally.</p>
